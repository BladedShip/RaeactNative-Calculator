# Inception

I gave myself 6 hours to get started with React Native and start developing something basic. Used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fYgGS46h2w "this") tutorial to get me started, also got the stylesheets from the same.

No I am not a crazy person

# Where now?

Next target, build a complete full stack application using React Native and Firebase in under 24 hours. Have no idea where I should start, with me having zero experience with Backend or APIs. Let's fuck up myself more.

# About

This project uses React Native running on TypeScript. To get started, clone this repository using 
```shell
	git clone https://github.com/BladedShip/RaeactNative-Calculator.git
```
Use `npm i` to install all the required dependencies and run the app using
```shell
	npx react-native run-android
```

The compiled apks might be included in the repo, but I'm not sure I'll add it in. Although, I will include the AAB files to quickly install and view it.
