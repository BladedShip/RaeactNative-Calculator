# Inception

I gave myself 6 hours to get started with React Native and start developing something basic. Used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fYgGS46h2w "this") tutorial to get me started, also got the stylesheets from the same.

No I am not a crazy person

# Where now?

Next target, build a complete full stack application using React Native and Firebase in under 24 hours. Have no idea where I should start, with me having zero experience with Backend or APIs. Let's fuck up myself more.
